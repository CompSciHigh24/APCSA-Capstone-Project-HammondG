# MUST DO!!!
	First, click Run to start the game.
	After clicking run," a GUI panel will pop up.  **Make sure you press the Maximize!** button on the top-right corner of the GUI. So that it can adjust to your screen size, 	also make sure to adjust the replit output by dragging the screen.
	If this is not done, the screen will not correctly display the X or O being placed 	because the GUI will automatically adjust the letters so that they do not go over the 	border that has been set.


# Rules of Tic Tac Toe:
	The game randomly picks whether the player is X or O.
	You can place your X or O on the GUI by just clicking where you want it to be placed.
	The game is a two-player game, so it would automatically switch between players when 	someone made a move.


# How to win:
	The game determines a winner by checking the buttons to make sure that it has a row 	in a row of X or O, so for example, if there are 3 X's straight across, the game 	will stop and X will be the winner.
	Once a winner is determined, a pop-up will be displayed that shows the amount of 	time the player who won has won so far. Click the OK button on the pop-up or the X 	button to close the pop-up.
If you feel the need to play again, all you need to do is click the Restart button located on the near right side of the screen.


## Enjoy playing the game!!!
